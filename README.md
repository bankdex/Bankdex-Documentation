All about Bankdex

# What is Bankdex?
BankDex is created on a powerful blockchain technology that ensures higher transaction per second. It overcomes the scalability limits of current blockchain systems with the BankDex protocol that balances the trade-off between throughput and latencies. This helps in the confirmation of initial transactions in seconds, in place of minutes as in regular blockchain transactions.
